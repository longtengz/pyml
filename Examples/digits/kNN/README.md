Using k-Nearest-Neighbors to recognize handwritten digits
--------------

- run **reduceData.py** first to perform data reduction on the data, and eventually to speed up the later kNN classifying process. Data reduction is applied by using the condensed nearest neighbors algorithm.

- run **runkNN.py**, it uses the condensed data to perform kNN.


Note
=====

**reduceData.py** will save a file containing all the condensed data reduced from the original data set into the *../data* directory
